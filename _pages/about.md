I am a Masterâ€™s student in the School of Mathematics and Computing (Computational Science and Engineering) at Yonsei University advised by [Prof. Jung-Il Choi](https://www.mpmc.yonsei.ac.kr/professor).
Prior to Yonsei University, I achieved a double major in Bachelor of Business Administration and Big Data Science (Data Analytics) at Sogang University.
During this period, I also had the opportunity to work in Research & Innovation team at SAP Labs Korea.

My research interest lies in creating machine learning models that can be applied in real-world settings, with a particular focus on analyzing <b>spatio-temporal data.
Through this focus, my ultimate goal is to apply these methodologies extensively in the field of sports analytics.
