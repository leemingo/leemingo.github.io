I am a Ph.D. student at Saarland University's [Institute of Preventive Medicine and Sports](https://sportmedizin-saarbruecken.de/en), conducting research on "Identification and characterization of injury-prone situations in football based on machine learning-based video analysis." funded by the Deutsche Fußball Liga (DFL). I am under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. med. Tim Meyer](https://sportmedizin-saarbruecken.de/en/staff/univ-prof-dr-med-tim-meyer), [Prof. Dr. Werner Krutsch](https://www.orthopaeden-langwasser.de/pd-dr-med-werner-krutsch/), and [Prof. Dr. Daniel Memmert](https://www.dshs-koeln.de/institut-fuer-trainingswissenschaft-und-sportinformatik/sportinformatik-sportspielf/personal/prof-dr-daniel-memmert/).

My research interest lies in creating machine learning models that can be applied in real-world settings, with a particular focus on analyzing <b>spatio-temporal data.
Through this focus, my ultimate goal is to apply these methodologies extensively in the field of sports analytics.

Prior to this, I was a Master’s student in the School of Mathematics and Computing (Computational Science and Engineering) at Yonsei University advised by [Prof. Jung-Il Choi](https://www.mpmc.yonsei.ac.kr/people/professor). I also achieved a double major in Bachelor of Business Administration and Big Data Science (Data Analytics) at Sogang University, and during this period, I had the opportunity to work in Research & Innovation team at SAP Labs Korea.
